409,"It's hard to vote on this. The contract article is fine, the fact that United completely disregards it is both deplorable and short sighted. Perhaps the client (AD) should be made aware the guards don't feel that we are being properly trained to do a good job in an emergency situation. I don't think that they would appreciate United ignoring necessary and contractually mandated training.","fine, good","hard, disregards, deplorable , don't, ignoring",negative,-2,This person feels like they are not being trained properly effecting their work,,
423,I would like that we as union members have to be more knowledge about our rights and discuss our concerns with our union reps. with maturity. We have to be united to gain as much as we can from United or AD. We have to work together and elect the best and brightest among us to solve our pJames lems.

430,So wait....it took them close to a YEAR to distribute physical copies of the contract? 61AL is a total scam and doesn't fight employers...61AL is owned by them and does what they are told. Let's find a union that will actually fight for us when we shower them in dues and fat checks from AD for theor sub par 61AL health plan.

448,"The only time that I've seen someone from the Union was when the restaurant workers were on strike. OUR Union reps approached me frequently to enlist my support for the RA people, which I was happy to do. I attended rallies and walked in support of them.However when OUR contract was being negotiated they disappeared. I sent numerous emails to our Union rep and did not receive one reply. They couldn't even extend the courtesy of answering an email from a Union member.","support, happy, attended, courtesy","strike, disappeared, not, couldn't ",negative,-5,The Union was not responsive to the person when they needed help but they were there for the Union when they needed the person,,
456,"The union doesn't seem to have any idea who's been assigned to what job, so it seems doubtful that United is providing information about job postings.",,"doesn't, doubtful",negative,-4,They do not like how unorganized the union is,,
473,"Another loss for guards. We didn't even gain anything for giving up this right. Just rolled over and took it from AD and United like on every other clause. Who cares about a 3.5% raise when real inflation is over 10%. Averaging 16 hours of work is a low bar for qualifying for benefits. For those saying it was never mentioned...start paying attention please...less than 50% of guards even voted on the last contract....in my opinion this was by design with the union purposefully trying to push through their 61AL Health Plan move. If people knew the truth about this, no 2nd or 3rd differential, and how bad the new health coverage fine print is..enough pissed off people would have sent Sara Smith, Ken and company back to the drawing board. We were kept in the dark just long enough so that they could run off with the 100M in the BBSE Health Fund...","gain, right, cares, qualifying, benefits, attention, purposefully","loss, didn't, low, less, bad, pissed, dark, ",negative,-5,The gaurds are getting the short end of the stick,,
